2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Make sure you have developer mode enabled
5. Click on the "Load unpacked" button
6. Select the folder containing the `manifest.json` file in the unzipped file

### Firefox

1. Download the latest `.xpi` file from the [latest release page](https://github.com/DanSnow/hoarder-pipette/releases/latest) on GitHub.
2. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.

<Aside type="caution">
Add-ons installed using the "Load Temporary Add-on..." method are **temporary** and will be removed when you close and restart Firefox. This is the current method for manual installation until Hoarder's Pipette is available on the official Firefox Add-ons store. For a persistent installation, please await the official store release.
