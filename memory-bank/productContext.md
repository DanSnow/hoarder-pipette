# Product Context: Hoarder's Pipette

## Why this project exists
To enhance the search experience for users of the Hoarder app by integrating their saved bookmarks directly into search engine results.

## Problems it solves
Users often forget or are unaware that they have previously bookmarked relevant information in their Hoarder app when performing web searches. This extension helps surface that information at the point of search.

## How it should work
The extension should detect when a user is on a supported search engine results page and query the Hoarder app API with the user's search query. It should then display relevant bookmarks alongside the standard search results in a clear and non-intrusive manner.

## User experience goals
- Seamless integration with supported search engines.
- Quick and easy identification of relevant bookmarked content.
- Minimal disruption to the standard search workflow.
- Clear indication of which results are from Hoarder bookmarks.
