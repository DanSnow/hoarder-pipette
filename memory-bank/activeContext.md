# Active Context: Hoarder's Pipette

## Current work focus
Initializing the memory bank based on the project's README, file structure, and recent feedback including open issues and pull requests.

## Recent changes
Created initial versions of `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`. Incorporated information about current priorities and related GitHub issues/PRs.

## Next steps
- Review the main `README.md` to ensure all critical information is captured in the memory bank.
- Explore the codebase, focusing on areas related to Firefox support, content scripts, and potential CSP implications.
- Investigate the PRs (244, 294) and Issue (57) related to the top priorities.
- Begin working on the top priority: Firefox support and CSP issues.

## Active decisions and considerations
- Ensuring the memory bank accurately reflects the project's current state, priorities, and known issues.
- Understanding the existing work on Firefox support (PR 244) and the Karakeep rebranding (PR 294).

## Important patterns and preferences
- Following the memory bank structure defined in `.clinerules/memory-bank.md`.
- Utilizing GitHub issues and PRs as sources of truth for project status and planned work.

## Learnings and project insights
- The project has a working Chrome version.
- Top priorities are Firefox support (with CSP), Karakeep rebranding, and note support.
- There are existing GitHub items related to these priorities (PRs 244, 294 and Issue 57).
