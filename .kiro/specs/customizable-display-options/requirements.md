- **Metadata**: Bookmark attributes including tags, description snippets, and date saved

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose between compact and detailed display layouts for my bookmarks, so that I can control the visual density on search result pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Settings_Interface SHALL provide a layout selection option with "Compact" and "Detailed" choices
2. WHEN the user selects "Compact", THE Bookmark_Display_System SHALL render bookmarks showing only title and URL
3. WHEN the user selects "Detailed", THE Bookmark_Display_System SHALL render bookmarks showing title, URL, description snippet, and tags
4. THE Storage_System SHALL persist the selected layout preference across browser sessions
5. THE Bookmark_Display_System SHALL apply the selected layout to all bookmarks displayed on search result pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle the visibility of specific bookmark information elements, so that I only see the most relevant details for my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Settings_Interface SHALL provide toggle controls for tags, description snippets, and date saved visibility
2. WHEN a visibility toggle is disabled, THE Bookmark_Display_System SHALL hide the corresponding information element
3. WHEN a visibility toggle is enabled, THE Bookmark_Display_System SHALL display the corresponding information element
4. THE Storage_System SHALL persist visibility preferences for each information element
5. THE Settings_Interface SHALL only show relevant toggles based on the selected layout

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to apply color-coded badges to my bookmarks based on their lists, so that I can quickly identify different types of bookmarks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Settings_Interface SHALL provide options to enable color badge display based on bookmark lists
2. WHEN color badges are enabled, THE Bookmark_Display_System SHALL display a colored indicator for each bookmark
3. THE Bookmark_Display_System SHALL assign consistent colors to bookmarks from the same list
4. THE Storage_System SHALL persist color badge preferences
5. THE Color_Badge SHALL be visually distinct and not interfere with bookmark readability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my display preferences to be remembered across browser sessions, so that I don't need to reconfigure them repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Storage_System SHALL save all display preferences when changes are made
2. WHEN the extension loads, THE Storage_System SHALL retrieve previously saved preferences
3. THE Bookmark_Display_System SHALL apply saved preferences to bookmark rendering
4. THE Settings_Interface SHALL reflect the current saved preferences when opened
5. IF no preferences exist, THE Extension SHALL use default display settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a preview of how my display changes will look, so that I can make informed customization decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Settings_Interface SHALL display a preview area showing sample bookmarks
2. WHEN display options are changed, THE Settings_Interface SHALL update the preview in real-time
3. THE preview SHALL accurately represent how bookmarks will appear on search result pages
4. THE preview SHALL include sample data for all bookmark information elements
5. THE preview SHALL reflect the selected layout and visibility settings
